❌ **Slow Quoting** - Manual calculations take hours or days  
❌ **No Standardization** - Quality varies by crew and experience  
❌ **Poor Scheduling** - Unknown production capacity makes planning difficult  
❌ **Limited Data** - No historical tracking of growth, stress, or patterns  
❌ **Inefficient Pricing** - Either under-bidding (lost profit) or overcharging (lost customers)  
❌ **Customer Confusion** - No transparency in how quotes are generated  
❌ **Scaling Problems** - Manual systems don't scale with business growth

### TreeShop Solution

## The 7 TreeShop Formulas

### Formula 1: TreeScore (Tree Removal & Assessment)

**The Core Formula**
```
TreeScore = H × (D ÷ 12) × 2 × R²

Where:
  H = Height in feet
  D = DBH (Diameter at Breast Height) in inches
  R = Crown Radius in feet
  
TreeScore Range: 16,000 to 2,500,000
Typical Range (Residential): 50,000 to 500,000
```

**Purpose**: Assess overall tree value and complexity for removal

**Who Uses It**: Arborists, urban foresters, property owners, insurance adjusters

**Time to Calculate**: <5 minutes with proper measurements

**Accuracy**: ±15% with proper measurement protocol

#### TreeScore Interpretation Scale

| Score | Size Class | Removal Complexity | Estimated Time |
|-------|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| <50,000 | Small | Low | 1-2 hours |
| 50,000-100,000 | Medium | Moderate | 2-4 hours |
| 100,000-200,000 | Large | High | 4-8 hours |
| 200,000-500,000 | Very Large | Very High | 8-16 hours |
| >500,000 | Giant | Extreme | 16+ hours |

#### Examples

**Example 1: Small Residential Tree**
```
Tree: 30 ft tall, 12" DBH, 15 ft crown radius
TreeScore = 30 × (12÷12) × 2 × 15²
         = 30 × 1 × 2 × 225
         = 13,500

Size: Small
Time: 1-2 hours
Cost: $300-600
```

**Example 2: Large Forest Tree**
```
Tree: 75 ft tall, 30" DBH, 38 ft crown radius
TreeScore = 75 × (30÷12) × 2 × 38²
         = 75 × 2.5 × 2 × 1,444
         = 541,500

Size: Very Large
Time: 8-16 hours
Cost: $1,500-3,000
```

**Example 3: Pacific Northwest Giant**
```
Tree: 150 ft tall, 40" DBH, 45 ft crown radius
TreeScore = 150 × (40÷12) × 2 × 45²
         = 150 × 3.33 × 2 × 2,025
         = 2,024,925

Size: Giant
Time: 16+ hours
Cost: $3,000-8,000+
```

#### Common TreeScore Ranges by Tree Type

| Tree Type | Typical Range | Example Species |

---

### Formula 2: StumpScore (Stump Grinding)

**The Formula**
```
StumpScore = DBH² × (Height + Grind_Depth)

Where:
  DBH = Diameter at stump level in inches
  Height = Height of remaining stump in inches (typically 12-18")
  Grind_Depth = Depth of grinding below grade in inches
  
Grind_Depth Guide:
  - Standard (prevent regrowth): 6 inches
  - Deep (remove major roots): 12 inches
  - Extra Deep (complete root removal): 18 inches
  
StumpScore Range: 1,000 to 50,000+
```

#### Example Calculations

**Example 1: Standard Residential Stump**
```
Stump: 14" DBH, 12" height, 6" grind depth
StumpScore = 14² × (12 + 6)
          = 196 × 18
          = 3,528

Equipment: Tracked grinder
Time: 30-60 minutes
Cost: $75-150
```

**Example 2: Large Tree Stump**
```
Stump: 30" DBH, 18" height, 12" grind depth
StumpScore = 30² × (18 + 12)
          = 900 × 30
          = 27,000

Equipment: Large tracked grinder
Time: 2-4 hours
Cost: $300-600
```

**Example 3: Giant Tree Stump (Deep Grind)**
```
Stump: 48" DBH, 24" height, 18" grind depth
StumpScore = 48² × (24 + 18)
          = 2,304 × 42
          = 96,768

Equipment: Heavy tracked grinder + cleanup crew
Time: 4-8 hours
Cost: $800-1,600
```

#### StumpScore Interpretation

| Score | Stump Size | Equipment | Time |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------|
| <5,000 | Small | Hand grinder | 0.5-1 hour |
| 5,000-15,000 | Medium | Tracked grinder | 1-2 hours |
| 15,000-30,000 | Large | Large tracked grinder | 2-4 hours |
| >30,000 | Very Large | Heavy equipment + cleanup | 4+ hours |

#### Production Rates (StumpScore per Hour)

- Small grinder: 3,000-5,000 SS/hour
- Medium grinder: 5,000-8,000 SS/hour
- Large grinder: 8,000-12,000 SS/hour

#### Common StumpScore Ranges

| Stump Size | Typical Score | Equipment | Price Range |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| Small (8-10") | 1K-2K | Hand grinder | $40-80 |
| Medium (12-18") | 2K-8K | Tracked grinder | $80-300 |
| Large (20-30") | 8K-20K | Large tracked | $300-800 |
| Very Large (36"+) | 20K-50K+ | Heavy equipment | $800-2,000+ |

### Formula 3: Mulching Score (Forestry Mulching)

**The Formula**
```
Mulching_Score = Acres × DBH_Package

Where:
  Acres = Project acreage
  DBH_Package = Preset maximum DBH for area
  
DBH Packages (Standard):
  - Package 2: Max 2" DBH (brush/small saplings)
  - Package 4: Max 4" DBH (small trees/dense brush)
  - Package 6: Max 6" DBH (mixed understory)
  - Package 8: Max 8" DBH (standard mixed forest)
  - Package 10: Max 10" DBH (mature mixed forest)
  - Package 12: Max 12" DBH (larger trees, mixed)
  - Package 15: Max 15" DBH (large tree forest)
  
Note: Trees exceeding package limit = separate line item
```

#### Example Calculations

**Example 1: 5-Acre Brush Clearing**
```
Project: 5 acres, max 3" DBH trees
Package: Package 4 (covers up to 4")
Mulching Score = 5 × 4 = 20 Mulching Points

Equipment: 70 HP mulcher
Production Rate: 30 points/hour
Time: 20 ÷ 30 = 0.67 hours
Cost: 0.67 × $150/hr = $100

(But realistically charged as minimum/day rate)
```

**Example 2: 10-Acre Mixed Forest Clearing**
```
Project: 10 acres, max 8" DBH trees
Package: Package 8
Mulching Score = 10 × 8 = 80 Mulching Points

Equipment: 100 HP mulcher
Production Rate: 50 points/hour
Time: 80 ÷ 50 = 1.6 hours
Cost: 1.6 × $200/hr = $320

(Realistically: 1-2 days @ $600-1,200/day)
```

**Example 3: 2-Acre High-Value Forest with Large Trees**
```
Project: 2 acres, max 18" DBH trees (exceeds Package 15)

Line Item 1: Mulching (up to 15")
  2 acres × Package 15 = 30 points
  Cost: $600-1,200

Line Item 2: Individual removal quotes for trees >15"
  Use TreeScore for each large tree
  Add to total project cost
```

#### Production Rate Model

```
Mulching_Score_per_Hour = Line_Item_Score ÷ Time_to_Complete

Equipment productivity:
- 50-70 HP mulcher: 20-40 Mulching Points/hour
- 70-100 HP mulcher: 40-60 Mulching Points/hour
- 100+ HP mulcher: 60-100+ Mulching Points/hour

Productivity factors:
- Dense brush: -20% (multiply rate by 0.8)
- Rocky soil: -15% (multiply rate by 0.85)
- Steep terrain: -25% (multiply rate by 0.75)
- Clear ground: +15% (multiply rate by 1.15)
```

#### Mulching Score Package Pricing

| Package | Max DBH | Typical Use | Price/Acre |
|---------|---------|-------------|------------|
| 2 | 2" | Brush only | $1,500-2,500 |
| 4 | 4" | Dense brush, small saplings | $2,000-3,500 |
| 6 | 6" | Mixed understory | $2,500-4,000 |
| 8 | 8" | Standard mixed forest | $3,000-5,000 |
| 10 | 10" | Mature mixed forest | $3,500-6,000 |
| 12 | 12" | Larger mixed forest | $4,000-7,000 |
| 15 | 15" | Large tree forest | $5,000-8,000 |

#### Pricing Formula

```
Mulching_Cost = (Mulching_Score ÷ Production_Rate) × Hourly_Rate

Example:
- Mulching Score: 50 points
- Production Rate: 30 points/hour (70 HP mulcher)
- Hourly Rate: $150/hour
- Cost = (50 ÷ 30) × $150 = 1.67 hours × $150 = $250

(Minimum charge typically applies)
```

---

### Formula 4: Trimming Score (Tree Trimming/Pruning)

**The Formula**
```
Trimming_Score = TreeScore × Trim_Percentage

Where:
  TreeScore = Base tree score from TreeScore formula
  Trim_Percentage = Percentage of crown being removed/reduced
  
Trim Percentage Guidelines:
  10-20% = Light cleanup (deadwood, minor shaping)
  20-30% = Moderate trim (crown thinning, shaping)
  30-40% = Crown reduction (structural pruning)
  40-50% = Heavy reduction (risky for deciduous, OK for palms)
  40-60% = Palm pruning acceptable range
  >50% = Warning flag for non-palm species
```

#### Example Calculations

**Example 1: Light Residential Trim**
```
Tree: 75 ft tall, 30" DBH, 38 ft crown
TreeScore = 541,500
Trim: 15% (light cleanup)

Trimming_Score = 541,500 × 0.15 = 81,225

Production Rate: 60,000 TS/hour
Time: 81,225 ÷ 60,000 = 1.35 hours
Cost: 1.35 × $125/hr = $169
```

**Example 2: Moderate Crown Reduction**
```
Tree: 50 ft tall, 24" DBH, 30 ft crown
TreeScore = 180,000
Trim: 30% (crown reduction)

Trimming_Score = 180,000 × 0.30 = 54,000

Production Rate: 50,000 TS/hour
Time: 54,000 ÷ 50,000 = 1.08 hours
Cost: 1.08 × $150/hr = $162
```

**Example 3: Palm Tree Maintenance**
```
Tree: 40 ft tall palm, 18" "DBH", 20 ft crown
TreeScore = 115,200
Trim: 50% (palm frond removal - acceptable)

Trimming_Score = 115,200 × 0.50 = 57,600

Production Rate: 70,000 TS/hour (palms faster)
Time: 57,600 ÷ 70,000 = 0.82 hours
Cost: 0.82 × $125/hr = $103
```

#### Trimming Interpretation

| Trim % | Service Type | Time vs Removal | Risk Level |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| 10-20% | Light cleanup | 15-25% of removal time | Low |
| 20-30% | Moderate trim | 25-40% of removal time | Low-Moderate |
| 30-40% | Crown reduction | 40-55% of removal time | Moderate |
| 40-50% | Heavy trim | 50-70% of removal time | High (deciduous) |
| 40-60% | Palm pruning | 50-70% of removal time | Low (palms only) |
| >50% | Extreme | Not recommended | Very High |

#### Production Rates (Trimming)

- Light trim: 60,000-80,000 TS/hour
- Moderate trim: 50,000-65,000 TS/hour
- Heavy trim: 40,000-55,000 TS/hour
- Palm trim: 60,000-90,000 TS/hour

#### Typical Pricing

| Service | Typical Cost | Range |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Light trim (residential) | $200-600 | $150-800 |
| Moderate trim | $600-1,200 | $500-1,800 |
| Crown reduction | $1,000-2,000 | $800-3,000 |
| Palm trimming | $100-300 | $75-500 |

### Formula 5: Clearing Score (Land Clearing)

**The Formula**
```
Clearing_Score = Acres × (DBH ÷ 12) × Height

Where:
  Acres = Project acreage
  DBH = Average tree DBH in area (inches)
  Height = Average tree height in area (feet)
  
Use Cases:
  - Residential lot clearing
  - Commercial site preparation
  - Right-of-way clearing
  - Forest land conversion
  - Agricultural land preparation
```

#### Example Calculations

**Example 1: Small Residential Lot**
```
Project: 0.5 acres, 8" avg DBH, 30 ft avg height
Clearing_Score = 0.5 × (8÷12) × 30
              = 0.5 × 0.667 × 30
              = 10

Time: 1-2 days
Cost: $500-1,500
```

**Example 2: Standard Residential Lot**
```
Project: 2 acres, 10" avg DBH, 35 ft avg height
Clearing_Score = 2 × (10÷12) × 35
              = 2 × 0.833 × 35
              = 58.3

Time: 3-5 days
Cost: $3,000-8,000
```

**Example 3: Commercial Land Clearing**
```
Project: 10 acres, 14" avg DBH, 45 ft avg height
Clearing_Score = 10 × (14÷12) × 45
              = 10 × 1.167 × 45
              = 525

Time: 2-4 weeks
Cost: $25,000-60,000
```

**Example 4: Large Forest Conversion**
```
Project: 100 acres, 18" avg DBH, 60 ft avg height
Clearing_Score = 100 × (18÷12) × 60
              = 100 × 1.5 × 60
              = 9,000

Time: 2-4 months
Cost: $200,000-500,000+
```

#### Clearing Score Interpretation

---

### Formula 6: Production Rate (Efficiency Tracking)

**The Formula**
```
Production_Rate = Score ÷ Time_to_Complete

Where:
  Score = Any TreeShop score (TreeScore, StumpScore, etc.)
  Time = Actual hours to complete job
  
Result: Score per hour (TS/hr, SS/hr, etc.)
```

#### Purpose

Track crew performance across all service types to:
1. Improve future estimates
2. Identify training needs
3. Optimize crew assignments
4. Benchmark against industry standards
5. Calculate accurate job costs

#### Example Calculations

**Example 1: Tree Removal Production Rate**
```
Job: 150K TreeScore completed in 3 hours
Production_Rate = 150,000 ÷ 3 = 50,000 TS/hour

Interpretation: Standard crew performance
Target range: 45,000-55,000 TS/hour
```

**Example 2: Stump Grinding Production Rate**
```
Job: 12,000 StumpScore completed in 1.5 hours
Production_Rate = 12,000 ÷ 1.5 = 8,000 SS/hour

Interpretation: Good performance
Target range: 6,000-10,000 SS/hour
```

**Example 3: Mulching Production Rate**
```
Job: 80 Mulching Points completed in 2 hours
Production_Rate = 80 ÷ 2 = 40 Mulching points/hour

Interpretation: Standard 70 HP mulcher
Target range: 30-50 points/hour
```

#### Target Production Rates by Service

#### Tracking Production Rates

**Weekly Analysis:**
- Calculate production rate for each completed job
- Average rates by crew
- Compare to historical data
- Identify trends (improving, declining, stable)

**Monthly Review:**
- Adjust baseline production rates
- Update pricing models
- Identify training opportunities
- Recognize top performers

**Quarterly Adjustment:**
- Update all production rate targets
- Adjust pricing formulas
- Benchmark against industry
- Set new performance goals

#### Using Production Rates

**For Estimating:**
```
Estimated_Time = Job_Score ÷ Production_Rate

Example:
Job: 200K TreeScore
Crew Rate: 50K TS/hour
Estimated Time = 200,000 ÷ 50,000 = 4 hours
```

**For Pricing:**
```
Job_Cost = (Job_Score ÷ Production_Rate) × Hourly_Billing_Rate

Example:
Job: 200K TreeScore
Crew Rate: 50K TS/hour
Billing Rate: $150/hour
Cost = (200,000 ÷ 50,000) × $150 = 4 × $150 = $600
```

**For Performance Reviews:**
```
Crew_Performance = Actual_Rate ÷ Target_Rate × 100%

Example:
Actual: 55K TS/hour
Target: 50K TS/hour
Performance = 55,000 ÷ 50,000 × 100% = 110% (excellent)
```

---

### Formula 7: Service Cost (Automated Pricing)

**The Formula**
```
Service_Cost = (Score ÷ Production_Rate) × Billing_Rate

Where:
  Score = Any TreeShop score
  Production_Rate = Historical points per hour for service/crew
  Billing_Rate = Your hourly billing rate
  
Result: Base job cost in dollars
```

#### Example Calculations

**Example 1: Tree Removal Quote**
```
Tree: 150K TreeScore
Production Rate: 50K TS/hour
Billing Rate: $150/hour

Service_Cost = (150,000 ÷ 50,000) × $150
            = 3 hours × $150
            = $450 base cost

Add modifiers:
+ Difficult access: +$100
+ Debris removal (3 cy): +$150
= Total Quote: $700
```

**Example 2: Stump Grinding Quote (3 stumps)**
```
Stumps:
- Stump 1 (14" DBH): 3,528 SS
- Stump 2 (12" DBH): 2,592 SS
- Stump 3 (16" DBH): 4,608 SS
Total: 10,728 StumpScore

Production Rate: 8,000 SS/hour
Billing Rate: $125/hour

Service_Cost = (10,728 ÷ 8,000) × $125
            = 1.34 hours × $125
            = $168

Minimum charge: $175
= Quote: $175
```

**Example 3: Mulching Project Quote**
```
Project: 5 acres, Package 8 (max 8" DBH)
Mulching Score = 5 × 8 = 40 points

Production Rate: 40 points/hour
Billing Rate: $150/hour

Service_Cost = (40 ÷ 40) × $150
            = 1 hour × $150
            = $150

But realistically: Use day rate
Day Rate: $600-800/day
= Quote: $600-800 (0.5-1 day project)
```

**Example 4: Complex Removal with Multiple Services**
```
Main tree removal:
TreeScore: 541,500
Rate: 50K TS/hour
Billing: $150/hour
Cost = (541,500 ÷ 50,000) × $150 = $1,625

Stump grinding:
StumpScore: 27,000
Rate: 8K SS/hour
Billing: $125/hour
Cost = (27,000 ÷ 8,000) × $125 = $422

Debris removal: 4 cubic yards
Cost = 4 × $50/cy = $200

Add modifiers:
+ Power line proximity: +$150
+ Weekend service: +15% = +$337

Total Quote: $1,625 + $422 + $200 + $150 + $337 = $2,734
```

## Formula Reference & Quick Guide

### The Complete TreeShop Formula Suite

```
1. TreeScore = H × (D÷12) × 2 × R²
   (Tree removal and assessment)

2. StumpScore = DBH² × (Height + Depth)
   (Stump grinding)

3. Mulching_Score = Acres × DBH_Package
   (Forestry mulching)

4. Trimming_Score = TreeScore × Trim_Percentage
   (Tree trimming/pruning)

5. Clearing_Score = Acres × (DBH÷12) × Height
   (Land clearing)

6. Production_Rate = Score ÷ Time_to_Complete
   (Efficiency tracking)

7. Service_Cost = (Score ÷ Production_Rate) × Billing_Rate
   (Automated pricing)
```

---

### Quick Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Small Residential Removal**
```
Tree: 30 ft tall, 12" DBH, 15 ft crown radius
TreeScore = 30 × (12÷12) × 2 × 15²
         = 30 × 1 × 2 × 225
         = 13,500

Production Rate: 50,000 TS/hour
Billing Rate: $150/hour
Cost = (13,500 ÷ 50,000) × $150
     = 0.27 hours × $150
     = $40.50 (minimum $300 applies)

Quote: $300
```

**Example 2: Large Tree Removal**
```
Tree: 75 ft tall, 30" DBH, 38 ft crown radius
TreeScore = 75 × (30÷12) × 2 × 38²
         = 75 × 2.5 × 2 × 1,444
         = 541,500

Production Rate: 50,000 TS/hour
Time = 541,500 ÷ 50,000 = 10.83 hours
Cost = 10.83 × $150 = $1,625

Add:
+ Debris removal (4 cy): $200
+ Difficult access: $100
= Quote: $1,925
```

**Example 3: Stump Grinding (3 stumps)**
```
Stump 1: 14" DBH, 18" total (12" height + 6" depth)
= 14² × 18 = 3,528

Stump 2: 12" DBH, 18" total
= 12² × 18 = 2,592

Stump 3: 16" DBH, 18" total
= 16² × 18 = 4,608

Total: 10,728 StumpScore

Production Rate: 8,000 SS/hour
Time = 10,728 ÷ 8,000 = 1.34 hours
Cost = 1.34 × $125 = $168

Quote: $168
```

**Example 4: Forestry Mulching**
```
Project: 5 acres, mostly 6-8" trees
Package: 8 (covers up to 8" DBH)
Mulching Score = 5 × 8 = 40 points

Production Rate: 40 points/hour (70 HP mulcher)
Time = 40 ÷ 40 = 1 hour
Cost = 1 × $150 = $150

(But use day rate)
Quote: $600-800/day
```

**Example 5: Tree Trimming**
```
Tree: 50 ft tall, 24" DBH, 30 ft crown
TreeScore = 50 × (24÷12) × 2 × 30²
         = 50 × 2 × 2 × 900
         = 180,000

Trim: 25% (moderate crown reduction)
Trimming_Score = 180,000 × 0.25 = 45,000

Production Rate: 55,000 TS/hour
Time = 45,000 ÷ 55,000 = 0.82 hours
Cost = 0.82 × $125 = $103

Minimum: $150
Quote: $150
```

### TreeScore Measurement (5-10 minutes)

**Equipment Needed:**
- Diameter tape or calipers
- Clinometer (or smartphone app)
- Measuring tape (100 ft)
- Notepad or smartphone

**Height Measurement:**
1. Stand 50-100 ft from tree (distance = 1-1.5× tree height)
2. Use clinometer to measure angle to top
3. Use clinometer to measure angle to base
4. Calculate height or use clinometer reading directly
5. Record to nearest 5 feet

**Smartphone Apps for Height:**
- Measure (iOS) with AR
- Measure Tree Height (Android)
- Clinometer (both platforms)

**DBH Measurement:**
1. Locate breast height (4.5 ft above ground on uphill side)
2. Wrap diameter tape around trunk (reads diameter directly)
3. Or use calipers and multiply by π (3.14159)
4. On slopes: Measure from uphill side
5. Record to nearest 0.5 inches

**Special Cases:**
- Multiple stems: Measure each, use average or combined
- Lean: Measure at 4.5 ft along stem
- Irregularities: Take multiple measurements, average
- Swelling at base: Move up to avoid buttress

**Crown Radius Measurement:**
1. Stand at trunk
2. Measure widest direction (e.g., North-South)
3. Measure perpendicular direction (e.g., East-West)
4. Crown Radius = (North-South + East-West) ÷ 4
5. Record to nearest 1 foot

**Example:**
- North-South: 80 feet
- East-West: 72 feet
- Crown Radius = (80 + 72) ÷ 4 = 38 feet

**Quality Check:**
- Re-measure if measurements seem inconsistent
- Compare to similar trees (sanity check)
- Take photos for reference
- Note any unusual conditions

---

### StumpScore Measurement (2 minutes)

**At Stump:**
1. Measure diameter at ground level (or highest point if irregularly cut)
2. Use diameter tape or measure circumference ÷ π
3. Measure remaining stump height in inches (from ground to top)
4. Note desired grind depth (standard = 6", deep = 12", extra = 18")
5. Record to nearest 1 inch

**Special Cases:**
- Multiple stems: Measure each separately
- Irregular cut: Use average height
- Partially removed: Estimate original diameter

---

### Mulching Assessment (10-15 minutes)

**Site Walk:**
1. Walk entire project area
2. Identify maximum DBH present
3. Estimate density (sparse, moderate, dense)
4. Note terrain (flat, rolling, steep)
5. Identify obstacles (rocks, buildings, utilities)

**Package Selection:**
- Find the largest tree on site
- Select package that covers largest DBH
- Trees larger than package 15 = separate removal quotes

**Acreage:**
- Use property survey if available
- GPS measurement (smartphone apps)
- Estimate using Google Maps (measure tool)
- County GIS data

**Modifiers:**
- Dense brush: -20% production rate
- Rocky soil: -15% production rate
- Steep terrain: -25% production rate
- Clear ground: +15% production rate

---

### Best Practices

**Always:**
- Take photos of every tree/project
- Document unusual conditions
- Note obstacles and hazards
- Record location (GPS coordinates or address)
- Get measurements in daylight when possible

**Safety:**
- Look up before measuring
- Identify hazards (power lines, dead branches)
- Wear appropriate PPE
- Stay clear of active work zones
- Don't measure in severe weather

**Accuracy:**
- Measure twice if unsure
- Compare to known references
- Use proper tools (not estimates)
- Record immediately (don't rely on memory)
- Note measurement date

**Documentation:**
- Take wide shot showing entire tree
- Take close-up of trunk (DBH location)
- Take overhead shot (crown)
- Note tree condition
- Record species if known

## Complete Quick Reference

### All TreeShop Formulas (One Page)

```
1. TreeScore = H × (D÷12) × 2 × R²
   Where: H = Height (ft), D = DBH (in), R = Crown Radius (ft)
   
2. StumpScore = DBH² × (Height + Depth)
   Where: DBH = Diameter (in), Height = Stump height (in), 
          Depth = Grind depth (in)

3. Mulching_Score = Acres × DBH_Package
   Where: Acres = Project acreage, DBH_Package = 2/4/6/8/10/12/15

4. Trimming_Score = TreeScore × Trim_Percentage
   Where: Trim_Percentage = 0.10 to 0.60 (10-60%)

5. Clearing_Score = Acres × (DBH÷12) × Height
   Where: DBH = Avg DBH (in), Height = Avg height (ft)

6. Production_Rate = Score ÷ Time_to_Complete
   Where: Time = Actual hours to complete

7. Service_Cost = (Score ÷ Production_Rate) × Billing_Rate
   Where: Billing_Rate = Your hourly rate
```

A: Measure each DBH separately, then either:
- Average them: (DBH1 + DBH2 + DBH3) ÷ 3
- Or combine: √(DBH1² + DBH2² + DBH3²)
- Use combined for total TreeScore

**Q: What if measurements vary significantly?**
A: Take 2-3 measurements, use average. If >10% variance, investigate cause.

**Q: How accurate do measurements need to be?**
A: ±5-10% is acceptable. The formula handles small variations.

**Q: Should I always use actual production rate?**
A: Yes, after you have baseline data. Adjust rates quarterly based on actual performance.

**Q: Can I adjust billing rates?**
A: Yes! Use modifiers for:
- Difficult jobs (+20-30%)
- Volume discounts (-10-15%)
- Seasonal rates (+10% summer, -10% winter)

**Q: What if customer thinks price is too high?**
A: Show the calculation, explain the formula, demonstrate fairness. Don't race to the bottom.

**Q: How do I handle emergency/storm work?**
A: Use 1.5-2.0× multiplier on final cost. Customers understand premium for urgency.
